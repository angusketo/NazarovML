Deconvoluting the Effects of Substituents on Reaction Barrier Heights through Machine Learning: The Case of Br√∏nsted Acid-Mediated Nazarov Cyclizations

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to reproduce  Random Forest (RF) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) models capable of making BH predictions for Nazarov cyclizations. Additionally, sterimol feature data (generated using DBStep) is provided alongside a Jupyter notebook that can be used to create more feature data for new substituents in the future. Corresponding conda environments are also provided.
